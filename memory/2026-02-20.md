# 2026-02-20

- Recapped Mission Control push goals (SLA command board, agent roster upgrades, faux-folder files viewer, shell polish).
- Verified Escalation Playbooks upgrades stayed live under approved schema change.
- Cleaned ROADMAP; only SLA board + polish items remain unchecked by design.
- Automation cron jobs updated to always pull/log before parsing roadmap with longer timeouts, but they currently fail because no `origin` remote is configured.
- Multiple cron loops hit API rate limits throughout the afternoon/evening; noted need to add git remote + upstream and dial back cron frequency/backoff.
