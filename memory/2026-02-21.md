- Confirmed SLA Command Board widget (per-priority clocks, risk bands, needs-attention list) is live on both Mission Control dashboard and Intelligence views, relying only on existing created/updated/priority/status fields.
- Fed Prisma's `updatedAt` through queries and relaxed `SlaTaskSummary` typing so "time since last touch" works without schema changes; lint stays clean.
- Automation jobs remain rate-limited; plan is to pause or extend backoff until git remote/upstream is configured and quota resets.
- Startup audit keeps flagging missing `WORKFLOW_AUTO.md` and daily memory logs; created the memory entries and still need to define the workflow file.
- Delivered the Agent Roster upgrade: new scoreboard tiles for TODO/DOING/DONE counts, 48h idle badge powered by existing task/memory timestamps, stuck ribbons, and last-touch metadata without touching schemas.
