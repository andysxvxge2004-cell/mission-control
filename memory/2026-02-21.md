- Confirmed SLA Command Board widget (per-priority clocks, risk bands, needs-attention list) is live on both Mission Control dashboard and Intelligence views, relying only on existing created/updated/priority/status fields.
- Fed Prisma's `updatedAt` through queries and relaxed `SlaTaskSummary` typing so "time since last touch" works without schema changes; lint stays clean.
- Automation jobs remain rate-limited; plan is to pause or extend backoff until git remote/upstream is configured and quota resets.
- Startup audit keeps flagging missing `WORKFLOW_AUTO.md` and daily memory logs; created the memory entries and still need to define the workflow file.
- Rebuilt the Mission Control Files view into faux Office Space folders (Role, Soul, Memories, Tasks, Audit) with copy buttons, role filters, and search—all powered by existing Prisma data.
- Polished the Mission Control shell (header spacing, KPI strip frame, alerts, chip styling) plus SLA board gradients/needs-attention emphasis and hover/copy feedback—all without schema or API changes.
- Added the Executive Snapshot panel so the control room shows total agents, idle >24h, SLA warning/breach counts, high-priority stale work, and oldest open task age using only derived timestamps.
